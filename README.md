cs50 Final Project

# Rent-A-Reptile
#### Video Demo:  <URL HERE>


#### Description:
My completion of CS50 coincided with an intensive Ruby on Rails bootcamp that I was also taking in the hopes of cultivating my technical stack, thus it was intuitive for my final project to crossover with the courses content.

We decided to create a website called 'Rent-A-Reptile' with similar functionality to Air-BnB. 

I played a significant role across the stack reflected in both the number, but also quality of the commits made to the github repository. 

Front-End

Stylistically, I wanted an eye catching homepage, hence the use of the gif and marquee that trails in the same direction. We stuck with a green centred pallete for out call-to-action buttons that was in line with the reptilian theme. I took charge of the buttons and was particulary proud of the booking call-to-action which feautures four spans that add flourescent prongs, thus making that particular option more alluring to users; an incentive in the that would benefit the company were it to be real and for-profit.

We designed the user story to be an intuitive as possible, with relevantly descriptive route names and a flow that incentivises users to partake in the functionality of our app. 

Back-end

The seeds were really important for the demostration of the user story, so their creation was of great importance. The images were imported from Cloudinary and we selected those that suited our colourscheme best. 

Our CRUD actions flow seamlessly and are made initutive by their front-end sequencing. To improve, I'd like to add validations in future, but for demo purposes this wasn't pertinent. 

Overallm, I'm really proud of the project and my contribution to it. It was a lovely learning experience being able to bridge all the content I've been learning and apply it in such a unique context. As proud as I am, I believe there are many improvements that could be made that may prove to be invaliable learning expereinces for me, so I hope to execute these in the near future.
