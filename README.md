cs50 Final Project

My completion of CS50 coincided with an intensive Ruby on Rails bootcamp that I was also taking in the hopes of cultivating my technical stack, thus it was intuitive for my final project to crossover with the courses content.

We decided to create a website called 'Rent-A-Reptile' with similar functionality to Air-BnB. 

I played a significant role across the stack reflected in both the number, but also quality of the commits made to the github repository. 

Front-End
Stylistically, I wanted an eye catching homepage, hence the use of the gif and marquee. We stuck with a green centred pallete for out call-to-action buttons that was in line with the reptilian theme.

We designed the user story to be an intuitive as possible, with relevantly descriptive roots names and a flow that incentivises users to partake in the functionality of our app. 

Back-end
The seeds were really important for the demostration of the user story, so their creation was of great importance. The images were imported from Cloudinary and we selected those that suited our colourscheme best.
